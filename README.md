# Bee-R-V2
Repository for a university project which is a VR game called Bee R. Storage ran out on v1 and it was a bit messy, hence new try on v2.

### Installation
1. Clone this project to your local system 
	- click "code" and copy url here
	- open the git bash in your local folder
	- type "git clone" and paste the copied url + press enter
2. Copy the "Oculus" folder from "/Assets" and paste it in the new project in "/Assets"
3. Open Unity and under open project, select the cloned project folder
	- make yourself a cup of tea, rewatch your fav netflix series and then come back to unity (took me roughly 7 min. loading)
	- if errors occure - ignore them
	- save file as new scene and close
	- reopen Unity file and everything should work ðŸ˜Š
